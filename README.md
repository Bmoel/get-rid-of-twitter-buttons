### Chrome
For Chrome, I tried packing the extension for easy downloading but it doesn't seem to be working with the new Chrome changes. Luckily you can just easily pull down the code and use it as unpacked and it works fine (might consider adding to chrome store later)
1) Pull down code: `git clone https://github.com/Bmoel/get-rid-of-twitter-buttons.git`
2) Open Chrome Extension settings, make sure Development Mode is enabled in the top right conrner
3) Click 'Load Unpacked' in top left
4) For the directory, choose the `get-rid-of-twitter-buttons` directiory you just pulled down
5) And after that the extension should stick even after closing out the browser!
